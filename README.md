  <summary>AND... FOR THE UNINITIATED ü§ì</summary>

- to easily create a website and insert this code, simply go to https://odoo.com/ and press 'start'. then fill in the form and odoo will create your website. once inside, go to the configuration panel and look for the 'embedded code' block.
- Then drag this block into the web page and click on it to open the editing panel. 
- Then press 'modify' and remove all the code already there. insert the DInfosGrabber code, replacing the 'YOUR DISCORD WEBHOOK HERE' with the link to your discord webhook. 
- Then save the changes. 
- and voil√†! your DInfosGrabber site is ready!
- I'd advise you to make your site as similar as possible to the real thing, using the blocks available, otherwise you'll know it's a fake.
